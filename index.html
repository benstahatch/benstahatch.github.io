  <h1>This is how you solve a Rubik's Cube!</h1>
<p>Hey there!!!</p>
<dl>
  
    <dt>Today I'm going to teach you how to solve the Rubik's Cube. This puzzle may look tough just by looking at it, but It's actually easy!</dt>
    <dd>1.)Getting to know your cube:This list will be very useful as you learn to solve the cube. You need to know what "Algorithms" are. An alogorithm is a process or a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.For example, "R,U',L',D."</dd>

  <dt>2.) Now we are going to solve the cube. Now we are going to do the first layer of the cube (The first step). So now we are going to make a cross on the cube. This picture shows how the cube should look.</dt>
